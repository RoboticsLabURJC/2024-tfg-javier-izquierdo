The main objective for this week was to fix some bugs in the BT editor and start adding the BT monitor in BT Studio and fix issues in the frontend of some exercises in RA.

## Changes in BT Studio

- Start working in the fixes needed to stabilize the BT editor and the BT monitor
- Continue testing execution inside the RB

## Changes in Robotics Academy

Fixed the [issue](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/issues/2464) by rewriting the frontend entirely to use css and html to properly display the layout.
