The main objective for this week was to continue close as many issues as possible in Robotics Academy and to create the slides for the BT Studio presentation.

## Slides for BT Studio

Not really much to say here, but if you want to take a look at the slides click [here](https://github.com/JdeRobot/bt-studio/pull/127).

## Robotics Academy switch to 1 class GUI and gui_interfaces

After needing to change the basic vacuum cleaner from 1 class to 2 in order to make it work, we promised to come back at it and solve it.

So this week we started checking what was wrong with it and found that in the frontend there was missing the acknowledge response to the backend.

With this out of the way and after a couple of changes caused by the random changes of variables between different access we had a workin prototype.

As all of the exercises were changed to a 1 class GUI we realized that a lot of the code was being repeated, so in order to remove this I created gui_interfaces, a python package that mostly does what hal_interfaces did, but for the GUI.

With all of the changes applied we manage to reduce the amount of code per GUI significantly.

Here is the 2 PR that handled this proccess and also the PR from Robotics Infrastructure: https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/pull/2650, https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/pull/2640 and https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsInfrastructure/pull/421

## Solving more issues in Robotics Academy

Some of the more notable ones are the addition of the old worlds to the follow line and amazon warehouse exercises and also fixing how the basic vacuum cleaner exercise frontend was linked with its backend.
