This demo is a mix of the challenges found around the page 59 in [here](https://athome.robocup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022_rulebook.pdf).

## Installation

Before starting make sure you have installed ROS2 humble in your system and sourced the ros underlay. It is highly recommended to add this line at the end of your .basrhc file.

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

First install the actual demo package found in [here](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2024-tfg-javier-izquierdo/demo/patrolling_demo.zip) and move it to the workspace:

```bash
mkdir -p demo_ws/src
mv patrolling_demo.zip demo_ws/src
unzip demo_ws/src/patrolling_demo.zip
```

Now install the additional packages needed:

```bash
cd src/patrolling_demo/
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Ar-Ray-code/darknet_ros_fp16.git

vcs import < patrolling_demo/thirdparty.repos
vcs import < fortress_sim/thirdparty.repos
```


Now the only thing left is init Rosdep and compiling (Note that you need to be in the root if the workspace):
```bash
cd ../.. # If you are already in root DO NOT EXECUTE THIS
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```

## How to launch

For the moment being, this is not an easy task so please execute each of the following commands in a different terminal, also make sure to always be sourcing the workspace:

```bash
TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle ros2 launch fortress_sim simulation.launch.py # Wait for a minute
# Now wait until this is completely launched
ros2 launch fortress_sim navigation_sim.launch.py
ros2 launch darknet_ros darknet_ros.launch.py
```

And for last, launch the demo (if it gets stuck before going to the door for the first time please reset both the simulation and the navigation).
```bash
ros2 run patrolling_demo executor
```
