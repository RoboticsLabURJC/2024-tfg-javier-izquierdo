This week my objective was to finish the migration of another excercise and updating all the documentation for the last one.

## Migrating time

This week I migrated the obstacle avoidance excercise from RoboticsAcademy to ros2 with humble.

All of this can be seen in the nexts pull requests: [#2498](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/pull/2498), [#2507](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/pull/2507) and also in this one from RoboticsInfrastructure: [#383](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsInfrastructure/pull/383).

I also updated the solutions for both of this excercises but I cannot link that here for obvious reasons.
