The objective for this week was to create a new and more complex demo using BT Studio and Gazebo Fortress.

## Trying to use Gazebo Fortress



## Bug hunting

I created issues for the bugs I had already discovered last week. You can see the issues here:

- Import bug: [issue](https://github.com/JdeRobot/bt-studio/issues/74)
- Node order bug: [issue](https://github.com/JdeRobot/bt-studio/issues/73) 

## Demo

We continue with the demo as said in the last week update.

For the full explanation and installation guide please go to [this post](../Demo).

### Progress

The challenge this week was to add suport for Yolov4 and dialog_flow.

The first one was quite easy as I knew what I failed last week. So with ease I added the WaitPerson action that returns success when there is a person less than 1.5 meters away.
In the demo video it is shown this with a small portrait to simulate a person.

Sadly, dialog_flow couldn't be added into this demo because it's API is only available in C++, so instead I used input() as a way of adding the ability for the user to interact with the demo.
