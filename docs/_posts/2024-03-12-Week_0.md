## Setting up the blog

I started th blog using the [chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) and following the installation guide that can be found [here](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/).

The only issue while setting it up was that the github actions did not work if the blog was inside the docs directory, so I changed them. This new actions can be found [here](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2024-tfg-javier-izquierdo/blob/main/.github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml).

## Downloading Ros2 Humble

As I already had it downloaded I didn't need to do it again. But if you do not have it follow the guide that you can find [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html).

Also, you may want to wait for the next LTS release that is coming on May 23rd this year [Jazzy Jalisco](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Releases/Release-Jazzy-Jalisco.html). This new LTS will be the first one to oficially support Gazebo Harmonic, so it is important for our needs.

## Downloading Gazebo Harmonic

You may follow the guide from [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/docs/latest/ros_installation) to install Gazebo Harmonic with Humble.

It is not difficult to installe it, but the problem arises when you have a ros package that needs gazebo because rosdep will always uninstall Harmonic and reinstall the an older version, this depends if the package uses Gazebo Ignition (Gazebo) or Gazebo Classic.

## BT Studio

As this is the base of my TFG, I needed to start to understand how it is implemented. The following video shows how it is used:

### Download

In order to download it, you only need to follow the instructions from the README file from the [official repository](https://github.com/JdeRobot/bt-studio).

### Things to note

When you install the dependencies with rosdep, you will get the warning that the tree_tools package has not been found. This does not matter, it will work, this warning is just because the package still does not have an Ubuntu packaging.

```bash
> rosdep install --from-paths src -r -y --ignore-src
        ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
        to system dependencies:
        laser_bump_and_go: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [tree_tools]
        Continuing to install resolvable dependencies...
        #All required rosdeps installed successfully
```

The important problem is that the demos available have one import setted up incorrectly. So if you are gonna use one of the demos make sure to change

```python
import tree_gardener 
```

for

```python
from tree_gardener import tree_tools
```

And the last thing is to remember to change the topic name of the subscribers and publishers to the one that matches the ones from your robot.
