## Downloading Ros Humble

![Humble](../images/humble_logo.png)

As I already had it downloaded I didn't need to do it again. But if you do not have it follow the guide that you can find [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html)

## Downloading Gazebo Harmonic


Follow the guide from [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/docs/latest/ros_installation) to install Gazebo Harmonic with Humble.

### Things to note:

- Add in .bashrc the following line to include gazebo:
```bash
  Helllo      
```

## Thing to improve about bt studio

- Indicator when action or node is selected: Done
- List of projects
- Not working well in Chromium: Done

I needed to change the imports of the demo projects from: import tree_tools to from tree_gardener import tree_tools
