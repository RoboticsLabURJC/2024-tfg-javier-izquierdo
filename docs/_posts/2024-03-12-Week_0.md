# Setting Up the enviroment

## Setting up the blog

With the chirpy theme

## Downloading Ros2 Humble

![Humble](docs/images/humble_logo.png)

As I already had it downloaded I didn't need to do it again. But if you do not have it follow the guide that you can find [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html).

Also, you may want to wait for the next LTS release that is coming on May 23rd this year [Jazzy Jalisco](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Releases/Release-Jazzy-Jalisco.html). This new LTS will be the first one to oficially support Gazebo Harmonic, so it is important for our needs.

## Downloading Gazebo Harmonic

You may follow the guide from [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/docs/latest/ros_installation) to install Gazebo Harmonic with Humble.

It is not difficult to installe it, but the problem arises when you have a ros package that needs gazebo because rosdep will always uninstall Harmonic and reinstall the an older version, this depends if the package uses Gazebo Ignition (Gazebo) or Gazebo Classic.

## Thing to improve about bt studio

- Indicator when action or node is selected: Done
- List of projects
- Not working well in Chromium: Done
- Problems with tree_tools: Done

I needed to change the imports of the demo projects from: import tree_tools to from tree_gardener import tree_tools
