The main objective for this week was to close as many issues as possible in Robotics Academy and to improve the lacking user documentation for BT Studio.

Also another goal was to try creating a new miniRADI in order to be able to upload the new version of the now called Robotics Backend

## Adding more user documentation to the website

I moved the user documentation that was in the main branch to this new page and also added a couple more tips.

## Solving issues in Robotics Academy

The ones I solved can be found [here](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3A%40me+is%3Aclosed), but the ones that I could not resolve were the ones related to the use of the NVIDIA GPU inside the docker.

The other one that was not closed was this [one](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/issues/2633) because the issue was found to be of the px4 package that is not managed by us.
