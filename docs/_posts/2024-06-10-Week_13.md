## Solved bugs from diagram

All of the bugs known to be related to the diagram and the nodes are supposed to be resolved with this update.

## Changing zoom controls

As the zoom before was really unintuitive because of it's inversed controls, now it works in a more natural manner.

## Refining the exercises from Robotics Academy

Both of the remaining exercises to be updated to the new hal_interfaces were updated (3D reconstruction and Amazon warehouse).

Also the amazon warehouse exercise was optimised obtaining an all around 50% to 100% increase in FPS and RTF.
