## Version 0.4 of BT Studio

The video of the version was released on youtube and it is only missing the public announcement.

Now we have almost solved every single issue with the 11 core exercises for Robotics Academy. This can be seen with the new release of Robotics Academy [here](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/releases/tag/v5.2.3).
