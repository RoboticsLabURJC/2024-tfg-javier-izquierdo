The main objective for this week was to relase the version 0.8 of BT Studio and to continue to add in Unibotics the support for cloud storage for BT Studio. Also I started helping with the modifications needed inside the RAM for the new drone exercise.

## Changes in BT Studio

- Added back the accent colors for the actions.
- Replaced all remaining JavaScript code with TypeScript.
- Fixed more minor bugs.
- Released version 0.8.

## Changes in Unibotics

Continue learning how to connect to S3 using the python sdk.
