The main objective for this week was to fix some bugs in BT Studio, in RAM and in RA.

## Changes in BT Studio

- Added a new file explorer.
- Fix errors on checking valid names in the new action modal.
- Continue working on how to send the custom universes to the RB
- Continue testing execution inside the RB

## Changes in Robotics Academy

Worked on fixing the [issue](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/issues/2576) caused by the ports in docker not being free due to the docker image not being removed properly.

## Changes in RoboticsApplicationManager

Fixed the [issue](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsApplicationManager/issues/156) that displayed an error message when terminating a VNC connection.
