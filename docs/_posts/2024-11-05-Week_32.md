The main objective for this week was to fix some bugs in the custom universes and to start preparing a demo in BT Studio, removing RA from the Robotics Backend and bug fixing in Unibotics.

## Changes in BT Studio

- Fix bugs with the custom universes that prevented them from working.
- Start creating a demo using a new RoboCup challenge as a base.

## Changes in Robotics Backend and RAM

- Removed Robotics Academy from the Robotics Backend.
- RAM now recieves all the necessary files for launching the user code from BT Studio and RA as a zip file.
