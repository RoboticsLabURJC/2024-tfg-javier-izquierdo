The main objective for this week was to prepare the 0.7 version and add the BT monitor with subtrees in BT Studio and to improve the exercises frontend in RA. Also I continue working in loading the new databases inside Robotics Academy.

## Changes in BT Studio

- Start testing BT Studio before the 0.7 release
- Add to the BT monitor the capacity to work with subtrees.

## Changes in Robotics Academy

- Improved frontends in the more exercises.
- Removed old usless files.
- Start working on loading the databases in Django.
