This week I will not have much to share because most of the work was in solving big issues.

## Big issue solved

The nodes of the behaviour tree being put in an incorrect position when downloading the package and causing it to misbehave was solved in this [issue](https://github.com/JdeRobot/bt-studio/issues/73).

## Demo finished

The official release of the recepcionist demo (previously patrolling demo) happened this week, with the new video release on Youtube.

This video and all the info about the demo can be found in [this post](../Demo).

## Other stuff

I also ported an exercise from [RoboticsAcademy](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy) from Ros1 to Ros2 and solved another couple of minor bugs in BT Studio.

The migrated exercise can be found in this [pull request](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/pull/2491).
