## New dialog window for editing actions

Now finally it is finished and it doesn't have any (I hope) bugs.

With this addition, now the number of times when you are required to input something in a browser prompt has been reduced to 0.

The next steps are to connect the action explorer and the diagram engine in order to change the names of the actions in various places in order to make it cohesive.

The PR for this ca be found [here](https://github.com/JdeRobot/bt-studio/pull/89) and this is a video of how the new action editor works, it may change in the future (the color chooser will change for sure).

Here is the PR I created for [this](https://github.com/JdeRobot/bt-studio/pull/89) and for now it is implemented to open a new modal window to change color,inputs and outputs of all the action nodes of that action created and also the future ones.

## Outside of BT Studio

I also started the migration of the localiced vacuum cleaner to ros humble in order to finished the job done by [Oscar](https://github.com/OscarMrZ), and after some problems with the threading library of Python not working properly I was able to get it to work. This can be seen in this [PR](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/pull/2538)
