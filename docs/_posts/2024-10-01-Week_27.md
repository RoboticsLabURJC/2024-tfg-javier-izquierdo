The main objective for this week was to add back some lost features in the BT editor in BT Studio and to improve the exercises frontend in RA. Also I started working in migrating the RA database to PostgreSQL and separating it into 2 parts: the exercises that will be in RA and the universes that will be in RI.

## Changes in BT Studio

- Added back the action and tag editors.
- Continue writting some basic documentation for the webpage.
- Continue testing execution inside the RB.

## Changes in Robotics Academy

- Improved multiple exercises frontends the same way as the Follow Line one, using css and html.
