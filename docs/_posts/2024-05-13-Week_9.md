## Work in progress

Finally the bug that caused the diagram to revert to a previous state has been fixed and now I can start working fully in the modal window. What caused this bug was the way the rerendering was implemented in the diagram editor that created a new engine each time it needed to be rendered.

Here is a video of the new feature:

Here is the PR I created for [this](https://github.com/JdeRobot/bt-studio/pull/89) and for now it is implemented to open a new modal window to change color,inputs and outputs of all the action nodes of that action created and also the future ones.
