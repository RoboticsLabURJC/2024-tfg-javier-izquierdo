The main objective for this week was to release the 0.7 version and solve more minor bugs in BT Studio and to finish implementing som features in RA. Also I finished implementing the load of the new databases inside Robotics Academy.

This last part also meant that the database migration has now ended.

## Changes in BT Studio

- Release version 0.7.
- Fix order problems in the BT monitor.
- Fix minor bugs.

## Changes in Robotics Academy

- Start working on improving the way the user code is sent to the RB.
- Update urls inside the documentation.
- Finished working on using the stop button as a semi-restart when the code is changed.
- Finished working on loading the databases in Django.
