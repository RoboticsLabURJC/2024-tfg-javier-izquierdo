The objective for this week was to create a new and more complex demo using BT Studio and Gazebo Fortress.

## Downloading Gazebo Fortress

You may follow the guide from [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/docs/latest/ros_installation) to install Gazebo Fortress with Humble.

This version at the very least did not get uninstalled every time I used rosdep but the problem is that the kobuki package that I use for the simulation uses Gazebo Classic, so there is the need to change it Fortress. 

## Demo

The objective for this demo is to recreate a basic competition challenge: recepcionist.

For the full explanation please go to [this post](../Demo).

### Why this challenge?

I chose this challenge because I had already done it in C++ and more importantly because it uses a broad number of ros features:

- Actions: Integration with nav2
- Other packages: For example Yolo or DialogFlow 
- Tf

### Progress

As this week was very busy in University I tried to just get one part done.

At first I tried with the integration of Yolo but because of a problem with the imports packages I desisted.

So the next part was the integration with Nav2, and after a little bit of suffering and a bit of jankiness I got it to work.
As only this part cannot be consider a recepcionist I rename it to patrolling because that is what it does, it goes from one point to another indefinitely.
