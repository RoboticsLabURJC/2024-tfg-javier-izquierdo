The main objective for this week was to continue close as many issues as possible in Robotics Academy and to start working in adding the RB to BT Studio.

## Changes in BT Studio

- Solve bugs when creating an action using templates
- Start the universe modal for universe management
- Start working on how to send the custom universes to the RB
- Start testing execution inside the RB
- Fix issues with the text editor

## Changes in Robotics Academy

- Tesing multithreading GUI ended in a failure due to the client failling to connect.
- Move all the interfaces (gui, hal and console) to the common folder inside RA
- Create 1 prototype to fix https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/issues/2464
