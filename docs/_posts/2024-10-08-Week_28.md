The main objective for this week was to add back some lost features in the BT editor in BT Studio and to improve the exercises frontend in RA. Also I continue working in migrating the RA database to PostgreSQL and separating it into 2 parts: the exercises that will be in RA and the universes that will be in RI.

## Changes in BT Studio

- Added back more deleted features.
- Fix some bugs inside the BT monitor.
- Continue testing execution inside the RB.

## Changes in Robotics Academy

- Resize vacuum cleaner map to 1012x1012.
- Fix code snippets in Obstacle Avoidance documentation. [Link](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/issues/2780).
- Improved frontends in the exercises Global Navigation and Amazon Warehouse.

## Changes in Robotics Infrastructure

Added the universe database

## Changes in Unibotics

Remove redundant code by making Unibotics properly grab the resources from the RA submodule.
