The main objective for this week was to continue adding the BT monitor and start the documentation in BT Studio and fix issues in the RAM related to Unibotics.

## Changes in BT Studio

- Finish working in the fixes needed to stabilize the BT editor.
- Add the BT monitor necessary config in the RAM
- Start writting some basic documentation for the webpage
- Continue testing execution inside the RB

## Changes in RoboticsApplicationManager

- Added a file watcher inside a server launched in the visualization step to send the BT state to BT Studio.
- Start working on adding a "style evaluation" as a stateless function.
